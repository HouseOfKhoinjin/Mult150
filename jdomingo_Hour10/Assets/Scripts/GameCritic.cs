 1. Is the game too easy or hard?

    A: it feels too easy at the beginning and too hard near the end. Once it begins, 3 of the balls just go in by itself after half a minute. After that, it gets a bit tedious trying to get the last one in, which explain more about in the 4th question

 2. What would make it easier or harder?

    A: making the normal balls slower or the the goals bigger would make the game easier, while making the chaos balls bigger would make the game harder
 
  3. What would give it a "wow" factor? 
 
    A: In my opinion, making it so that the goal makes a little explosion before deleting itself sounds cool. Other than that, some music would be nice
 
 4. What parts of the game are fun? What parts are tedious?
 
    A:  I find it fun using the chaos balls to knock the normal balls into the goal. However, the normal speeds feel a bit too slow, because I always end up missing the balls by an inch
