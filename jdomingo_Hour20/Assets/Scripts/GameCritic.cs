Is the game too easy or hard? Give 2 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.

I would honestly say the game was too easy because: 

1. the obstacles are incredibly small, meaning they're easily avoidable
2. there's a lot of open space around the hall

What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?

1. change the size of the obstacles
2. make it so that collecting powerups set the speed back to normal

List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.

1. add a counter for all the power ups you collected
2. add an explosion for when you collect power ups

What 2 parts of the game are fun? 

1. collecting the power ups felt satisfying
2. movement feels really good for some reason

What 2 parts of the game are tedious?
 
1. The timer number is off balance and that bothers me so much more than it should
2. I wish there was a way to turn off the hologram/phaseout mat after you press it
 
Changes: 
 
 changed the Triggerzone size so that more items will get deleted
 Blended the color of the particle lights with a little
